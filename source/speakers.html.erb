	            <p class="topic-summary">Programming is difficult. As programmers, we know how hard it is to write good code. Some of the job of a good programming language is to make this easier. In part, languages do that by having a convenient syntax and good libraries. But there's something else, too. They should make you happy when you use them, because then you'll do your best work. <br/><br/>

The Ruby language makes me happy. Interestingly, many of the reasons I'm happy using Ruby are the same reasons my wife and I love being in China. <br/><br/>

In this talk I'll explore the reasons why both China and Ruby make me happy.</p>

	            <h2>Shrink To Grow</h2>
	            <p>Ruby has grown in the last 20 years. The feature-set and field of usage has increased. But also its code-size has reached an exceptional size. For many systems Ruby is nowadays to large.<br/><br/>

                To reach new systems we have to re-think the way we implement Ruby. We have to shrink Ruby to be able to grow into a new field with an army of small devices.<br/><br/>

                This talk will cover the development of mruby. The current state of the implementation and the reason why you should contribute to it.

	            <p>RSpec is a popular tool for TDD with ruby. In this talk, we start with the seemingly easy topic on using subject and let. Then we dive into the debate on testing using should_receive vs. asserting side effects. We walk through the pros and cons of both approaches and conclude this section with different scenarios when each approach excels. Last part of this talk covers some traps and caveats of RSpec.</p>
